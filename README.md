📘 Employee Management System in C++
📌 Description
The Employee Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ that allows users to manage employee records efficiently. It supports basic operations like adding, displaying, updating, searching, and deleting employee details. This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in C++, such as classes, objects, and file handling.

🛠️ Features
Add new employee records

Display all employees

Search employee by ID

Update employee details

Delete employee records

Store data using file handling (optional for persistence)

🧱 Technologies Used
Language: C++

Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming

Compiler: Any standard C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW, Turbo C++)

Platform: Console/Terminal
